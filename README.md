# Underwater Drone Mathematical Model

The main focus of this project is to understand the effect of medium changes on an underwater drone. We will use MATLAB to create a mathematical model of the drone and demonstrate the effects of phase change.

## Literature References

Several articles provide valuable insights into mathematical models for drones. Here are some references I've consulted:

1. **Thesis on Quadcopter**
2. **Autopilot Design for a Quadcopter**
3. **Mathematical Modeling of Quadcopters**
4. **Quadcopter Dynamics, Simulation, and Control**

## Geometry and Environmental Factors

The geometry of the drone and various environmental factors have been derived from the "Autopilot Design for a Quadcopter" article.

## Control System Development

As the project progresses, we plan to develop a control system that allows the drone to move from one point to another. Initially, we'll operate in an obstacle-free space, but eventually, we'll introduce obstacle handling capabilities. Our target completion date for this phase is July 2024.
