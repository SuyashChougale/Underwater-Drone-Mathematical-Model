# Underwater-Drone-Mathematical-Model

This projects main focus is to understand the effect of medium change on drone. We will use matlab to mathematical model the drone and to show the effects of phase change.
A lot of literature is already available on mathematical models of drone.I have mentioned few of them at end. I have closely followed "Quadcopter Dynamics, Simulation, and Control" article.
Geometry of drone is referred from "Autopilot Design for a Quadcopter" article.


Project is still in progress!!
