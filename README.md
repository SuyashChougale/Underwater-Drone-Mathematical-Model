# Underwater-Drone-Mathematical-Model

This projects main focus is to understand the effect of medium change on drone. We will use matlab to mathematical model the drone and to show the effects of phase change.
A lot of literature is already available on mathematical models of drone.I have mentioned few of them at end. I have closely followed "Quadcopter Dynamics, Simulation, and Control" article.
Geometry of drone and different environmental factors are referred from "Autopilot Design for a Quadcopter" article.

The Articles which I have referred are,
 1.a thesis on quad copter 
 2.autopilot design for a quad copter 
 3.mathematical modeling of quad popular 
 4.quadcopter dynamics simulation and control 

Further, I am planning to make a control system for the drone to move from one point to another initially I will keep obstacle free space but as the project progresses we will also introduce control to handle the obstacles. I hope this will be done by July 2024.
